# 🌿 About Mi

## 👩🏻‍💻 Frontend Engineer

Hi! I’m Mi — a frontend developer and lifelong learner passionate about how technology and creativity can help us reconnect with our authentic selves.  

I’ve been in the tech industry for over 15 years.  

In 2019, I experienced burnout, which made me more aware of the importance of taking care of my mental health.
Since 2020, I’ve been working daily to build a sustainable way to keep growing — both as a professional and as a person.  

After transitioning to frontend development in 2022, I realized I still faced deep challenges with **mental health** and **focus**.  
I needed to rebuild my emotional foundation before I could dedicate time and energy to developing my coding skills after work hours.  

That inner work has changed everything. 🤍  

Now, I’m combining my love for **learning**, **frontend engineering**, and **generative AI** to create blogs and digital spaces that reflect both technical skill and emotional depth.

I truly ♥️ learning — it’s a source of pure ✨JOY✨.

### 🌱 What I’m Exploring Now

- Building blogs with **Next.js + React + Tailwind CSS**  
- Experimenting with **GenAI** as a creative partner  
- Integrating emotional well-being and tech learning  

🌀 Current hyperfocus (my special-interest zone): **GenAI for code, creative work & mental health expression**

### Support systems that changed my life

- 🌀 **Psychotherapy** – helped me understand my journey, patterns, and beliefs  
- 👨🏻‍⚕️ **Medical support** – helped me understand I’m on the spectrum (Autism + ADHD) and how to care for my brain  
- ✨ **Holistic therapies** – help me cultivate peace, balance, and creativity

### 💫 What I Believe

> Technology can be a mirror — reflecting not only what we can build,  
> but also **who we’re becoming while building**.

(☝ that one was 100% GenAI — but I agree, so I kept it 🤭)
