# 🌿 About Mi

## 👩🏻‍💻 Frontend Engineer

Hi! I’m Mi — a frontend developer and lifelong learner passionate about how technology and creative work can help us reconnect with our authentic selves.  

I’ve been in the tech industry for over 15 years.  

In 2019, I experienced burnout, which made me realize how important it is to care for my mental health.
By September 2020, I had finally gathered the courage to take meaningful action toward healing and seek professional help.
That journey transformed many areas of my life — including my career, as I transitioned from a Generalist Software Analyst to a Frontend Engineer.

After moving into frontend development in 2022, I realized I was still facing deep challenges with mental and emotional health.
I needed to keep working on rebuilding my emotional foundation before I could truly dedicate time and energy to growing my coding skills outside of work.

That inner work has changed everything. It was so worth it! ✨🤍✨

Sometimes I still get so caught up in my daily routines that I end up forgetting how much I love learning.

Then there are days like this (a Saturday!) when I know there’s nowhere else I’d rather be — just learning, exploring, and creating.

I truly ♥️ learning — it’s a source of pure ✨JOY✨.

Now, I’m combining my love for  **learning**, **frontend engineering**, and **generative AI** to take on [Frontend Mentor Challenges](https://www.frontendmentor.io/home), build personal projects, and just have some fun!✨🚀
