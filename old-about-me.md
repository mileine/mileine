# About Mi

## 👩🏻‍💻 Frontend Engineer

- In Tech Industry for over 15 years now.
- Started transition to Frontend Development in February 2022.
    - Due to mental health struggles, it was very hard to create and keep a consistent study routine after office hours.
    - Focused on improving mental and emotional health for 3 years. 🤍
    - Thankful and happy to see the inner work paid off and I'm ready to get my focus back to developing Frontend skills.
- I do ♥️ learning - a source of pure ✨**JOY**✨.

Some of the things I've learned during this journey:

- **Authenticity protects my mental health.**
    - And I do need my mental health to perform at my best in all areas of my life - including Tech.✨🚀
- **Allowing myself to build skills and confidence from the ground up.**
    - It took some time but I finally realized that I'll be able to collaborate so much more if I take the time to build a strong foundation on web technologies - rather than trying to keep up with themes senior developers are focused on.
- **Foundation matters**.

## 🤍 Mental Health Advocate

Since 2020, I've been working daily to build a sustainable way to keep growing - in all areas - while allowing myself to enjoy ✨LIFE✨.

I also learned about the importance of getting professional support when seem too much to handle. 

I've experienced a HUGE difference in my overall well-being because I got support from professionals in the areas below:

- **🌀 Psychotherapy**
    - … helped me to understand my journey, limiting belief systems and negative patterns, which allowed me:
        - making better choices and experiencing better results in life.
    - … helped me to make an inner move towards a sincere intention to forgive past "bad” decisions
- **👨🏻‍⚕️ Medical support**
    - … allowed me to understand that I'm on the spectrum and helped me to:
        - learn a lot about how my brain works and understand how to take care of it
        - respect my journey and accept my imperfect self
        - understand and forgive past "bad” decisions
        - get the courage I needed to seek support in CBT
- **✨ Holistic Therapies**
    - **… take care of my energy,** which helps me to:
        - stay calm during challenging situations
            - or quickly recover in cases I fail to do so
        - cultivate - or get back to - a state of ✨**peace of mind**✨
        - appreciate ✨**life**✨ and being the connected to the ✨**joy**✨ of living in the ✨**present**✨.

It's crystal clear to me now that taking care of our mental health **IS** part of investing in our career development. ✨🤍✨
